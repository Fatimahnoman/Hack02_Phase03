The backend server is now running on `http://127.0.0.1:8001`

## Working Credentials
**Email:** `newuser@example.com`
**Password:** `NewUserPassword123!`

## Frontend Configuration
Make sure your frontend is configured with:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001`
- This is already set in `frontend/.env.local`

## To Use the Application:
1. **Login/Register** using the credentials above
2. **ChatBot** - Use natural language to manage tasks
3. **Dashboard** - Use the UI to manage personal todos

## Both Systems Working:
✅ ChatBot task operations (create, list, update, complete, delete)
✅ Frontend task operations (via UI)
✅ Authentication system
✅ Database connectivity

Everything is now working properly!
